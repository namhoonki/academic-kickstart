title: "The Effectiveness of Monetary and Promotion Rewards in the Public Sector and the Moderating Effect of PSM (PSM-Reward Fit or PSM Crowding Out): A Survey Experiment"
abstract: To what extent does public service motivation (PSM) affect how monetary rewards and promotion opportunities motivate government officials?  This study offers an answer to this question through a survey experiment conducted with a sample of city government officials in Florida. The experimental results demonstrate that both monetary and promotion reward treatments positively motivate officials with low PSM. However, as the level of PSM increases, the positive treatment effect of the monetary reward decreases and converges on zero. Conversely, the positive effect of the promotion opportunity treatment not only decreases but becomes negative, indicating that PSM crowding out is taking place.

title: "Selective vs. Collective Outcomes of Collaborative Governance: The Impacts of Federal Stimulus Programs on Local and Regional Governance Outcomes"
abstract: A number of studies have demonstrated that local government’s self-governing mechanisms can bring about positive collective outcomes for an entire region. However, less attention has
been paid to different levels of collective outcomes (e.g., individual local governments vs. entire
regions). Comparing such selective and collective outcomes in interlocal collaborations, this study
attempts to explore which specific collaborative self-governing mechanisms can better work for
which respective outcomes. Applying network approaches with time-series cross-sectional data,
this study investigates how each local government’s network position and the network structure as
a whole influence the impact of Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants on job creation in
terms of the regional green economy. Empirical results demonstrate the need for separating selective and collective outcomes in developing theories of regional governance. Additionally, the results
provide practitioners with advice on how to manage interlocal relationships in order to maximize
collective outcomes at different levels
