title: "How Perceived Risks in Interorganizational Collaboration shape Disaster Response Strategies"
abstract: Interorganizational collaboration is a means, through which governments to effectively respond to disasters. However, the extent to which collaboration risks embedded in interorganizational relationships shape such collaborative arrangements largely remains unanswered. This study examined the impact of collaboration risks as perceived by organizational representatives with regard to emergency management (EM). To this end, we conducted an EM survey in Seoul in 2015 and analyzed the data using a quadratic assignment procedure logistic regression. The dyadic network analytic results demonstrated that the aggregate risks as perceived by paired organizations are negatively associated with the establishment of collaboration ties. In contrast, a significant disparity in the perceived risk levels between paired organizations promotes collaborative network arrangements; when one party perceives substantially lower collaboration risks relative to the other, it can create a favorable condition for both parties to initiate interorganizational collaboration.
